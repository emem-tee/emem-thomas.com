This is mostly a summary, but this week I have been trying to wrap my head around Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning. A method where changes are made to Large Language Models (LLMs) by applying changes to sections of the parameters. According to the [article](https://huggingface.co/blog/peft) by Mangrulkar and Paul, this applies specifically to Large Language Models based on the transformer architecture. This includes the big names of today; GPT, T5, and BERT (at least the big ones of the day in 2023).
